# GJ Show videos | Script, Edit, Sound Design | Paris

## The World Expo of Synthetic Biology

The iGEM Grand Jamboree is an event hosted in Paris each year. It is the World Expo of Synthetic Biology, attended by over 7000 people each year. 

## A mission to do good

I have been responsible for many creative aspects of how synthetic biology is presented on video. Synthetic biology in itself is a complex and promising field of biology, that combines engineering and biotechnology to come up with solutions to problems. At the Grand Jamboree people focus on using this technology to offer solutions to our most pressing issues, climate change, pollution, food production and so on. 

## Videos as centrepieces of Storytelling

My work here supports the communication about this mission. I provide the emotional undertone that these issues deserve. Storytelling engages people with these issues better than any explanation could. This is why thereâ€™s such a huge emphasis on bringing serious projection equipment to support this content. Videos are the centrepieces of the show and continue to engage the crowds who attend the Grand Jamboree. 

## Scripts

## The Super wide Village videos, opening videos

The LED wall is an over the top Ultra-Panavision 70. The aspect ratio is x : x and I was accounting for it in the process of coming up with videos. I used split screens. 

## Live Show video inspired by the Olympics

2024 marked a big year in the history of Paris. The city hosted the Olympic Games and the whole world was watching. iGEM decided to create its own version of the passing of the Olympic flame.

This one is special. I took the video from pitch to projection, and now this video lives also as a regular 16x9 video.
