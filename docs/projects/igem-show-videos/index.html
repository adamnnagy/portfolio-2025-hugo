<h3 id="the-world-expo-of-synthetic-biology">The World Expo of Synthetic Biology</h3>
<p>The iGEM Grand Jamboree is an event hosted in Paris each year. It is the World Expo of Synthetic Biology, attended by over 7000 people each year.</p>
<h3 id="a-mission-to-do-good">A mission to do good</h3>
<p>I have been responsible for many creative aspects of how synthetic biology is presented on video. Synthetic biology in itself is a complex and promising field of biology, that combines engineering and biotechnology to come up with solutions to problems. At the Grand Jamboree people focus on using this technology to offer solutions to our most pressing issues, climate change, pollution, food production and so on.</p>
<h3 id="videos-as-centrepieces-of-storytelling">Videos as centrepieces of Storytelling</h3>
<p>My work here supports the communication about this mission. I provide the emotional undertone that these issues deserve. Storytelling engages people with these issues better than any explanation could. This is why thereâ€™s such a huge emphasis on bringing serious projection equipment to support this content. Videos are the centrepieces of the show and continue to engage the crowds who attend the Grand Jamboree.</p>
<h3 id="the-super-wide-village-videos-opening-videos">The Super wide Village videos, opening videos</h3>
<p>The LED wall is an over the top Ultra-Panavision 70. The aspect ratio is x : x and I was accounting for it in the process of coming up with videos. I used split screens.</p>
<h3 id="scripts-and-mood">Scripts and Mood</h3>
<p>These videos were born out of the Covid era. In 2021 iGEM hosted its annual Grand Jamboree online and focus shifted from in-person presentations to video. It was a logical step for iGEM to produce its own videos about its mission. The videos remained in the in-person event of 2022, but they needed a revision. I developed the look and the atmosphere for this new, more cinematic iGEM. The scripts and the visuals reflect a more sincere approach to commitments towards sustainability and social good. The challenge here was to balance fatigue and ennui over the topics of climate change and environmental cleanup. How to talk about these topics in 2022? It has been over 50 years since the topics has entered public consciousness, and over 30 years since concerns over climate change gained widespread awareness.</p>

<p><strong>There is a clear evolution of production value that now includes the graphics and script.</strong></p>
<h3 id="live-show-video-inspired-by-the-olympics">Live Show video inspired by the Olympics</h3>
<p>2024 marked a big year in the history of Paris. The city hosted the Olympic Games and the whole world was watching. iGEM decided to create its own version of the passing of the Olympic flame.</p>
<p>The Biobrick Trophy used for 18 years was filled up with the names of the previous winners. A new Biobrick Trophy was designed and it replaced the old Biobrick Trophy at the final day of the Grand Jamboree.</p>

<p>This one is special. I took the video from pitch to projection, and now this video lives also as a regular 16x9 video.</p>
