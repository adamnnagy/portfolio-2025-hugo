## 
12’ - Hungary, 2019
Hungarian (Arabic and English subtitles Available)

## Selections:

Cinalfama Lisbon Screening and Awards (Lisbon, 2019)

## Synopsis:

Lili Pilári is directing her first shadow puppet theater performance where fish and sea mammals meet in the oceans’ deepest and best underwater circus (Sea show) to watch some wholesome talents in singing and gymnastics. With the help of her brother Áron and her parents Gábor Pilári & Zsuzsanna Vajda, she seeks to spread love and joy in the hearts of the kids in their magical family run puppet theater located in the small city of Pécs on the southern Hungarian border.

While she takes us in to a journey of magic and art in making her show, we get a glimpse on behind the makings of such a beautiful craft.
